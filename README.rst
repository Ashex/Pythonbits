Chapter 1 How-To
================
Section 1.1 Installation
------------------------
Download the latest version from the git repository. Drop the 2 files (pythonbits.py and MultipartPostHandler.py) in a folder inside your shellpath.
It is suggested to create a directory for usermade scripts in your homedirectory. We will not go into this in this document.

Section 1.2 Usage
-----------------
Usage: pythonbits.py "MOVIENAME/SERIENAME" moviefile > Textfile

Section 1.3 Clarification
-------------------------
The MOVIENAME/SERIENAME is required right now, further versions might make this an optional parameter. The moviefile is required, as this provides the Mediainfo and the 2 screenshots. ">" redirects the output (default STDOUT) to a textfile, for easier access, this is not required.

Section 1.4 Help and Bugs
-------------------------
Apollo (The main developer) is usually available on irc (irc.baconbits.org), poke him there to report a bug, or get help with the further usage of the script. This goes for contributing as well.
